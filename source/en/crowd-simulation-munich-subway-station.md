accu:rate was commissioned by the [Munich City Utilities - SWM](https://www.swm.de/) to implement a passenger simulation at a Munich subway station.

By means of the simulation critical passenger flows were examined in detail and possible measures to relieve the station were tested. The results are incorporated into the operational concept of the subway station in order to enable a smooth operation even during the rush hour.

If you also want to execute a pedestrian flow simulation for an infrastructural building - for example to check the operation in advance of planned construction projects - [contact us](kontakt) for an offer! We are happy to hear from you.
