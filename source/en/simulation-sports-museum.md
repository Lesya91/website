accu: rate supported using a visitor flow simulation capacity planning of a new sports museum on behalf of [THEMATA](http://www.themata.de/) (Potsdam). Here THEMATA and delivered [TRIAD](https://www.triad.de/de/projekte/fifa-world-football-museum/) (Berlin), the required input parameters for the simulation. Together with THEMATA the relevant scenarios were defined and simulated. The aim was to check the capacity of the exhibits at residence times adopted and degree of filling of the museum and can already be seen any possible bottlenecks during the planning phase and eliminate them.

Current information can be found [here](http://de.fifamuseum.com/about/media/press-releases/fifa-welt-fussball-museum-eroffnungstermin-steht-2609754/#).
