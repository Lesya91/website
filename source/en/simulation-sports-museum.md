Here is an example of one of our projects. We are happy to answer your questions! Please [contact](kontakt) us.

*Munich/Potsdam/Berlin/Zurich, 01 February 2016*

[![Logo THEMATA](img/referenzen/themata-logo.png)](http://www.themata.de/) {.referenzpreview}

On behalf of [THEMATA](http://www.themata.de/) (Potsdam) accu:rate supported the capacity planning of a new sports museum using a visitor flow simulation. THEMATA as well as [TRIAD](https://www.triad.de/de/projekte/fifa-world-football-museum/) (Berlin) provided the required input parameters for the simulation. Relevant scenarios were defined and simulated in cooperation with THEMATA. The aim was to check the capacity of the exhibits at assumed residence times as well as the filling degree of the museum and to recognize and eliminate any possible bottlenecks already during the planning phase.

Current information can be found [here](http://de.fifamuseum.com/about/media/press-releases/fifa-welt-fussball-museum-eroffnungstermin-steht-2609754/#).

If you also want to simulate visitor flows and calculate capacity already during the planning phase of your building - please [contact us](/en:contact) for an offer! We are happy to hear from you.
