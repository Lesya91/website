Construction of the fairy-tale castle, as it is often called, was already 1869. He moved into the castle in 1884 and lived only 172 days on the castle. Although he never wanted to make it available to the public, it was opened shortly after his death in 1886 for visitors - had to absorb a portion of the loans that King Ludwig II to build, pay off.

The fairytale castle is now one of the most visited castles in Europe. About 1.4 million people visit the "Palace of the fairy-tale king". At least since the castle as a model for the [Sleeping Beauty Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_Castle) in [Disneyland](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/) served, it is known far beyond the borders of Germany.
