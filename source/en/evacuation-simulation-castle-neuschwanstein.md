Here is an example of one of our projects. We are happy to answer your questions! Please [contact](kontakt) us.

In 1868 Ludwig II of Bavaria designed the Neuschwanstein Castle as an idealized version of a Middle Ages knight's castle.

The construction works of the fairytale castle, as it is often called, started already 1869. King Ludwig II moved into the castle in 1884 and lived there for only 172 days. Although he never wanted to make it available to the public, shortly after his death in 1886 it was opened for visitors. The reason to do this was to pay off a portion of King Ludwig loans.

The fairytale castle is now one of the most visited castles in Europe. About 1.4 million people visit the "Palace of the fairytale king" annualy. At least since the [Sleeping Beauty Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_Castle) in [Disneyland](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/) was modeled after the Neuschwanstein Castle, it is known well beyond the borders of Germany.

The [Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes](http://www.neuschwanstein.de/) is the current operator of the Castle and faces the challenge that a celebrity like this, and associated number of visitors, bears.

In the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single inhabitant. accu:rate supported the [State Building Authority Kempten](http://www.stbake.bayern.de/) in analyzing and optimizing the evacuation routes - so in case of emergency, all visitors can be routed out of the castle safely and in time.

If you also manage or operate a castle or a listed building and want to analyze the evacuation routes - [contact us](kontakt) for an offer. We are happy to hear from you!
