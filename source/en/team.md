After her studies in computer science at the TU Munich Dr. rer worked. nat. Angelika Kneidl as an IT consultant in the financial services industry. In 2009 she returned to the Technical University of Munich back and did a doctorate on "methods for imaging human navigation behavior in the modeling of pedestrian flows" at the Department of Computational Modeling and Simulation During this time she has received several awards for her work. You were two Best Paper Awards and awarded the promotion prize of the German friends of the TU Munich, recognizes outstanding promotions.

With accu:rate she is an expert in modeling and in its responsibility for the project business.

Florian Sesser completed his studies in computer science at the TU Munich 2011 successfully. He since 2001 working freelance in the IT industry and specializes in the architecture, development and quality assurance of software. In 2010, he called together with other experts the workshop software architecture to life. When his former employer, the IT: Agent - a service for individual solutions in Web and Internet environment - he took over development tasks besides the management of customer projects.

The [Munich University of Applied Sciences](http://www.cs.hm.edu/die_fakultaet/ansprechpartner/professoren/koester/index.de.html) explores the modeling and simulation of pedestrian flows since 2010, when Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Köster took their Chair of Scientific Computing. Prof. Köster has been working in the security research since 2007, in particular in the exploration and modeling of crowd flow simulations. When Siemens AG, Corporate Technology, it was until 2010 responsible for the topic "Crowd Control" and directed the subprojects to pedestrian flow simulation in the BMBF projects [SinoVE](http://www.bmbf.de/de/22453.php) and [REPKA](http://www.bmbf.de/de/22399.php). She puts in their research value on robust processes and applications close to practically implement scientific progress can.

Since 2010 she leads a research team at the University of Munich to pedestrian flow simulations. In the BMBF project [MEPKA](http://www.cs.hm.edu/aktuelles/news/newsarchiv2008/news_detailseite_19648.de.html) was developed „[Optimal Steps Model](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.86.046108)“, the people allowed a variable stride to realize its objective to. In the BMBF project [MultikOSi](http://www.multikosi.de/teilvorhaben-der-hm) she explores with her ​​team, as psycho-social behavior can be meaningfully integrated into computer models.

Prof. Köster is a member of the scientific committees of the [PED 2012](http://www.ivt.ethz.ch/news/archive/20120606_conference_ped_2012//), the [TGF 2013](http://www.fz-juelich.de/conferences/tgf13/EN/Home/home_node.html) and [PED 2014](http://www.ped2014.nl/en) , some of the most important conferences on crowd flow simulations.

The [Chair of Computational Modeling and Simulation](https://www.cms.bgu.tum.de/) under the direction of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. André Borrmann](https://www.cms.bgu.tum.de/de/team/borrmann) the modeling and simulation of pedestrian flows since its inception in 2012. One of the research priorities of the Department are scale transitions between different modeling levels (macroscopic, mesoscopic, microscopic) in persons current simulation. The chair is among others on Research Cooperation [MultikOSi](http://www.multikosi.de/) involved which the [BMBF](http://www.bmbf.de) is promoted.

The benefits of [VDS GmbH](http://www.vds-veranstaltung.de/) is based on 25 years of professional qualifications and practical experience in the visitor and event security. These include security consulting for operators, promoters and authorities and the preparation and implementation of security concepts in the form of safety coordination for events. One focus of the company is the Crowd Management (visitor management), which was used for example in the championship celebration of FC Bayern Munich in 2013 successfully. The VDS GmbH passes as project coordinator since 2013, the three-year research project [MultikOSi](http://www.multikosi.de/) that the [Federal Ministry of Education and Research](http://www.bmbf.de/) is promoted. The aim of the project is to explore support systems for the secure design and implementation of urban major events. The managing director Roland G. Meier since 2009 expert for event security and in public places, and since 2013 by the [German Association of Professional Experts (DGSV)](http://www.dgusv.de/) certified and tested "safety expert for places of assembly" (certificate of the  [TÜV Saarland](http://www.tuev-saar.net/)). He is 1 Chairman of the [Federal Association of Event Security](http://bvvs.org/).
