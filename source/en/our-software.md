accu:rate has been successful in analysis of pedestrian flows for 2 years using a modern, scientifically developed simulation model. The software to which we successfully handle projects on behalf of customers , we would like to offer as a product .

Therefore, there is now the possibility to test the beta version of our software crowd:it. We want namely selling only the highest quality products also in future.


## What is crowd:it?

* crowd:it is a software package for microscopic, agent-based simulation of pedestrians and generally people.

* It is a self-developed software based inter alia on Prof. Gerta Köster's Optimal Steps Model and Dr. Kneidls research at TUM


## Features of crowd:it

* We work with a continuous space model: Each point can be entered by a pedestrian. A fit of the model to the geometry is therefore not necessary (in contrast to cellular automata)

* Focusing on individual agents makes the reproduction of individual properties easy

* We offer an intuitive user interface and ease of use, which simplifies the working process and leads fast to results

* Floorplans are created using the modeling tool AutoCAD for later simulations

## System requirements

* Windows 7 or higher
* AutoCAD 12 or higher
* Java 8
* 4 GB RAM
* Internet access

Even if you are using a Mac, your AutoCAD version is older or you have another CAD software, we are happy to tap into additional platforms with you!


## How does the beta program work?

We are looking for technically savvy customers who want to participate in our beta program. In the beta version of crowd:it you can try out a pre-release software as software testers. 
Your feedback will help us to identify problems and make crowd:it even better. 
You will get technical support whenever it is necessary.
Contact our developers to ensure that you get a tool that gives yxou optimal support in your projects.


## Do I have to pay for the software?

Unfortunately we can not comp the beta software, but of course you'll not only get the test software but also the complete version of crowd:it when it's released.
