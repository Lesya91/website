King Ludwig II. Neuschwanstein Castle designed in 1868 as an idealized version of a knight's castle dating from the Middle Ages. Construction of the fairy-tale castle, as it is often called, was already 1869. He moved into the castle in 1884 and lived only 172 days on the castle. Although he wanted to make it not accessible to the public, it was opened shortly after his death in 1886 for visitors - to had to take out some loans, the King Ludwig II to build, pay off.

accu: rate was of the [Munich City Utilities](https://www.swm.de/) commissioned a [passenger simulation at a Munich subway station](personenstromanalyse-ubahn-station-muenchen-mvg) perform. Use the simulation were examined critical passenger flows in detail and tested possible measures to relieve the station. The results are incorporated into the operating concept of the station in order to allow a smooth operation even during rush hour. [Read more...](personenstromanalyse-ubahn-station-muenchen-mvg)



## [Neues Sportmuseum in Zürich](simulation-sportmuseum)
[![Logo THEMATA](img/referenzen/themata-logo.png)](simulation-sportmuseum) {.referenzpreview}

accu: rate supported using a visitor flow simulation capacity planning of a new sports museum on behalf of [THEMATA](http://www.themata.de/). The aim was to check the capacity of the exhibits at residence times adopted and degree of filling of the museum and can already be seen any possible bottlenecks during the planning phase and to eliminate it.
